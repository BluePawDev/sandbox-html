        <h1>Code Example</h1>
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Version Control System">VCS</abbr> is a component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the <i>revision number</i>, <i>revision level</i>, or simply <i>revision</i>.</p>
        <p>When using Git you will typically use command line code such as <code>$ git rebase master</code> or <code>$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</code>.</p>
        <h3>VCS Terms</h3>
        <p>Below are a few examples of terms related to VCS.</p>
        <p>These terms and their respective defintions are from Wikipedia's page: <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#Common_vocabulary">Version Control Common Vocabulary</q>, last modified on 18 January 2017, at 06:23 and accessed on 01 February 2017.</p>
        <dl class="vcsTerms">
          <dt>Baseline</dt>
          <dd>An approved revision of a document or source file from which subsequent changes can be made. See baselines, labels and tags.</dd>
          <dt>Branch</dt>
          <dd>A set of files under version control may be branched or forked at a point in time so that, from that time forward, two copies of those files may develop at different speeds or in different ways independently of each other.</dd>
          <dt>Change</dt>
          <dd>A change (or diff, or delta) represents a specific modification to a document under version control. The granularity of the modification considered a change varies between version control systems.</dd>
          <dt>Checkout</dt>
          <dd>To check out (or co) is to create a local working copy from the repository. A user may specify a specific revision or obtain the latest. The term 'checkout' can also be used as a noun to describe the working copy.</dd>
          <dt>Clone</dt>
          <dd>Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions.</dd>
          <dt>Commit</dt>
          <dd>To commit (check in, ci or, more rarely, install, submit or record) is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.</dd>
          <dt>Conflict</dt>
          <dd>A conflict occurs when different parties make changes to the same document, and the system is unable to reconcile the changes. A user must resolve the conflict by combining the changes, or by selecting one change in favor of the other.</dd>
          <dt>Head</dt>
          <dd>Also sometimes called tip, this refers to the most recent commit, either to the trunk or to a branch. The trunk and each branch have their own head, though HEAD is sometimes loosely used to refer to the trunk.</dd>
          <dt>Repository</dt>
          <dd>The repository is where files' current and historical data are stored, often on a server. Sometimes also called a depot.</dd>
